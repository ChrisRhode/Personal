        <li>The web page will give you a new Game ID number (a small integer), which you should remember.</li>
        <li>Go to the "Individual Player Access Page" on two different devices.  Enter "Guest 1" or "Guest 2" on the different devices for "Enter your ID", and the Game ID number from step 2, and click/tap "Enter Game", on the next page pick the die color for the player, and click/tap "Use this color!".</li>
        <li>You may be taken to a "Waiting on Player n" page.  When both devices have completed step 3, both devices will be taken to the playing page for the player (it may take a few seconds).</li>
        <li>A given player will be told if it is their turn, or if it's the other player's turn.  In the latter case the page auto refreshes every 10 seconds, so when the other player completes their turn, your browser will show the page for you to take your turn within 10 seconds.</li>
