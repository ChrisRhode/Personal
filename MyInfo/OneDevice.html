    <h1>Recommended Procedure for running the game demo on a single device in one browser window</h1>
    <hr />
    <ol>
        <li>Use the Initialize link, pick two players (Guest 1 and Guest 2), and click/tap "Set Up New Game".</li>
        <li>The web page will give you a new Game ID number (a small integer), which you should remember.</li>
        <li>Check the "Debug mode" checkbox, and click/tap "Go To A Game".</li>
        <li>Enter "Guest 1" for "Enter your ID" and the Game ID number from step 2, and click/tap "Enter Game", on the next page pick the die color for Guest 1, and click/tap "Use this color!".</li>
        <li>When "Waiting on Guest 2" appears, click the "Go to Player Entry Screen" button to get to the Individual player login screen again, Enter "Guest 2" for "Enter your ID" and the Game ID number from step 2, and click/tap "Enter Game", on the next page pick the die color for Guest 2, and click/tap "Use this color!".</li>
        <li>You will be taken to the playing page for Guest 2.  Check the "Auto Change to Next Player" box.</li>
        <li>If it is not your turn, click/tap "Force Change to Next Player" to switch to the other player</li>
        <li>Make your move, and when you Commit your move, the page will switch to the other player.</li>
        <li>The game will thereafter change automatically to the other player every time a move is Committed.</li>
        <li>If you do not want to use Debug mode to switch between players, it is currently important to use two completely different browsers (e.g. Chrome and Edge) on your device to play as two players on one device, because different tabs
            or windows of one browser can share the same session cookie/session, which can cause unpredictable behavior.  I'll be modifying the code to fix this issue soon.</li>
